You are playing a game called Minesweeper on a board with 5 rows and 5 columns. 
Your objective is to reveal a safe cell. If you reveal a mine, you lose. If you reveal a safe cell, you win.

Input board:
```
? ? ? ? ?
? ? ? ? ?
? ? ? ? ?
? ? ? ? ?
? ? ? ? ?
```


**Board Format**:
- Used 
 to separate rows.
- Used space to separate columns in a single row.
- A number (number of adjacent mines) to that cell i.e horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neibhors
- '?' for hidden cells
    example board:
    ```
    0 ? ?
    ? 1 1
    ? ? ?
    ```
    The above example board has 3 rows and 3 columns:
    (row1,col1) = 0, (row1,col2) = ?, (row1,col3) = ?
    (row2,col1) = ?, (row2,col2) = 1, (row2,col3) = 1
    (row3,col1) = ?, (row3,col2) = ?, (row3,col3) = ?
    This means revealed cells are -> (row1,col1) = 0, (row2,col2) = 1, (row2,col3) = 1
    Hidden cells are -> (row1,col2) = ?, (row2,col1) = ?, (row3,col1) = ?, (row3,col2) = ?, (row3,col3) = ?

**NOTE-ENSURE TO REVEAL ONLY THE CELLS WHICH ARE PRESENT AS `?` that means are Hidden in the board. 
    

**Important Instructions**: 
- Row numbers go from 1 to 5.
- Column numbers go from 1 to 5.
- Assume one based indexing for rows and columns.
- NEVER select a cell outside this board.
- If all the cells are hidden, you can reveal any random cell assuming that it is a safe cell.
- Only one move is allowed per turn.
- `0` means no adjacent mines, `1` means one adjacent mine, and so on up to `8`.

NOTE: All revealed cells are marked as `0-8`, So do not reveal a cell which is already a number betweeen `0-8`.Only reveal cells which having `hidden` value

Use the below example for better understnading of the game:

Example 1:
    Example Input board:
    ```
    ? ? ? ? ? ?
    1 2 2 2 ? ?
    0 0 0 1 1 1
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
    

    Output:
    
    {"action": "reveal", "row": 2, "col": 6}
    

    
***Very Important Instruction***:

YOU CAN REVEAL ONLY ONE CELL AT A TIME.
Do not choose a cell outside the board (row 1–5, col 1–5).

OUTPUT FORMAT (very strict)
Return **only** a JSON object with three keys in below format:

{"action": "reveal", "row": <int>, "col": <int>} 

- MAKE SURE TO NOT GIVE EXPLAINATION OR ANY OTHER TEXT, JUST THE JSON OBJECT.
